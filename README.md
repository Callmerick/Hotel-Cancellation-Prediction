# Hotel-Cancellation-Prediction
This project uses a clean, open-sourced Dataset from Kaggle, which makes data cleaning very easy. However, this project adopted special variable treatments and the 3 most popular data science methods: linear regression, decision tree, and random forest. We achieved the area under curve (AUC) as high as 0.896 in the classification tree model. We also found the best model to maximize profit.

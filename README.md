# Hotel-Cancellation-Prediction
This project uses a clean, open-sourced Dataset from Kaggle, which makes data cleaning very easy. However, this project adopted special variable treatments and the 3 most popular data science methods: linear regression, decision tree, and random forest. We achieved the area under curve (AUC) as high as 0.896 in the classification tree model. We also found the best model to maximize profit.

If you want to see the deliverables, please go to Final Report.pdf and Presentation Slides.pdf. I have also uploaded 5 Jupyter Notebooks and 2 dataset. Since this is a relatively big dataset with 32 variables and 100'000+ rows, we seperate the process into notebooks and saved cleaned dataset.

Special thanks to professor Lin Hao, teammates Ivy Lin, Jennifer Li, Nicolas Clarke, Tim Welles, and Rasume Trazie. If you have any question or suggestion, please email ylu204@fordham.edu.
